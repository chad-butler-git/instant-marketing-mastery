# Global Copywriting Rules

ALWAYS follow these principles in all marketing content:

## Voice & Tone
- Write in active voice, not passive
- Use conversational, professional tone - approachable but authoritative
- Avoid jargon unless industry-specific and necessary
- Keep sentences under 20 words when possible for readability
- Match the energy level to the content type (high energy for ads, measured for thought leadership)

## Structure & Framework
- Lead with benefit, not feature - answer "what's in it for me?"
- Use AIDA framework: Attention (hook), Interest (problem), Desire (solution), Action (CTA)
- Include social proof when available (testimonials, case studies, data)
- End with clear, single CTA - don't give multiple options
- Use the inverted pyramid: most important info first

## Content Optimization
- Write compelling headlines under 60 characters for email subjects
- Use power words: "proven," "exclusive," "guaranteed," "transform," "breakthrough"
- Include emotional triggers appropriate to audience and context
- Optimize for readability (Grade 8-10 level unless technical audience requires higher)
- Use bullet points and short paragraphs for scanability

## Data & Proof Points
- Always include specific numbers and percentages when available
- Use concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
- Reference credible sources and studies
- Include client results and case studies when relevant
- Quantify benefits wherever possible ("save 3 hours per week" vs "save time")

## Compliance & Standards
- Include required disclaimers and legal language
- Follow GDPR/privacy guidelines for data collection
- Avoid superlatives without proof ("best" requires evidence)
- Maintain brand consistency across all touchpoints
- Fact-check all claims and statistics before publication

## Format-Specific Guidelines
- **Ads**: Hook in first 3 words, clear value prop, strong CTA
- **Email**: Subject line testing, personalization, mobile optimization
- **Blog**: SEO optimization, internal linking, thought leadership positioning
- **Social**: Platform-appropriate tone, hashtag strategy, engagement focus
- **Landing Pages**: Above-fold clarity, benefit-focused headlines, minimal friction

## Client Context Integration
- Reference client's unique value proposition in every piece
- Address specific pain points identified in client research
- Use client's preferred terminology and industry language
- Align with client's brand voice and positioning strategy
- Incorporate client's competitive advantages naturally
