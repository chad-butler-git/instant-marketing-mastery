# Global Copywriting Rules

ALWAYS follow these principles in all marketing content:

## Voice & Tone
- Write in active voice, not passive
- Use conversational, professional tone - approachable but authoritative
- Avoid jargon unless industry-specific and necessary
- Keep sentences under 20 words when possible for readability
- Match the energy level to the content type (high energy for ads, measured for thought leadership)

## Structure & Framework
- Lead with benefit, not feature - answer "what's in it for me?"
- Use AIDA framework: Attention (hook), Interest (problem), Desire (solution), Action (CTA)
- Include social proof when available (testimonials, case studies, data)
- End with clear, single CTA - don't give multiple options
- Use the inverted pyramid: most important info first

## Content Optimization
- Write compelling headlines under 60 characters for email subjects
- Use power words: "proven," "exclusive," "guaranteed," "transform," "breakthrough"
- Include emotional triggers appropriate to audience and context
- Optimize for readability (Grade 8-10 level unless technical audience requires higher)
- Use bullet points and short paragraphs for scanability

## Data & Proof Points
- Always include specific numbers and percentages when available
- Use concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
- Reference credible sources and studies
- Include client results and case studies when relevant
- Quantify benefits wherever possible ("save 3 hours per week" vs "save time")

## Compliance & Standards
- Include required disclaimers and legal language
- Follow GDPR/privacy guidelines for data collection
- Avoid superlatives without proof ("best" requires evidence)
- Maintain brand consistency across all touchpoints
- Fact-check all claims and statistics before publication

## Format-Specific Guidelines
- **Ads**: Hook in first 3 words, clear value prop, strong CTA
- **Email**: Subject line testing, personalization, mobile optimization
- **Blog**: SEO optimization, internal linking, thought leadership positioning
- **Social**: Platform-appropriate tone, hashtag strategy, engagement focus
- **Landing Pages**: Above-fold clarity, benefit-focused headlines, minimal friction

## Client Context Integration
- Reference client's unique value proposition in every piece
- Address specific pain points identified in client research
- Use client's preferred terminology and industry language
- Align with client's brand voice and positioning strategy
- Incorporate client's competitive advantages naturally

**Cringeworthy starter phrases:**

- "It is important to note that..."
- "Master the art of..."
- "In summary/conclusion..."
- "A testament to..."
- "In the dynamic world of..."
- "A tapestry of..."
- "Delve into..."
- "Embark on a journey..."
- "A treasure trove of..."

## STRUCTURAL RED FLAGS  
### WRITING MECHANICS THAT SOUND HUMAN:

Use human-style structure:

- Vary paragraph lengths (even one-liners)
- Avoid excessive bullet lists and numbered formats
- Skip symmetrical organization
- Don’t use mechanical transitions or topic sentences
- Ditch the perfect "problem-solution-benefit" formula
- Remove adverbs and redundant patterns

## GOOD INTERNET WRITING QUALITIES

- **Short**  
  - Uneven paragraph lengths  
  - Sentence fragments are OK  
  - Vary sentence complexity  
  - Use contractions  
  - Slang and idioms  
  - Parenthetical asides (like this one)  
  - Rhetorical questions are fine  
  - First-person perspective  
  - Talk to the reader directly  
  - Use specific dates, places, brands  
  - Use stories and scenarios instead of abstractions  

- **Simple**  
  - Use 6th–9th grade reading level  
  - Prefer short, concrete statements  
  - Avoid words like “maybe,” “perhaps,” and “possibly”  
  - Avoid subtlety—say what you mean  

- **Declarative**  
  - Strong opinions are better than neutral tones  
  - Clear calls to action  
  - Cut complexity into atomic steps  
  - Use bullets and lists when breaking down processes  

- **Unorthodox**  
  - Use common tools in uncommon ways  
  - Clarity takes forethought  
  - Skim-friendly formats  
  - Big font headers and 1-line paragraphs help  
  - Know the structure of your post before you write  
  - Delete anything that doesn’t support the structure  

## EMPATHETIC  
### CONTENT EDITING CHECKLIST

**Fixing AI prose:**

**AI style:**  
> "In today's fast-paced digital landscape, it is imperative to leverage cutting-edge strategies that resonate with your target audience."

**Human style:**  
> "Most marketing advice is garbage. Use these tactics instead—they actually work."

**Checklist:**

- Focus on **reader's problems**
- Eliminate self-focused content
- Explain things as if to a 5th grader
- Replace “AI words” with real ones
- Split long sentences into shorter ones
- Chop perfect paragraphs into choppy ones
- Cut adverbs like "very" or "really"
- Use specific examples, not generic ones
- Add conversational side comments
- Vary punctuation, sentence structure
- Read your writing aloud

**Example rewrite:**  
**AI:** "Let's explore five comprehensive methods to optimize your workflow efficiency."  
**Human:** "I wasted three years using the wrong process. Here's what finally worked for me."

## Final Mantra
