# Instant Marketing Mastery

A comprehensive Claude Code template system for marketing agencies to instantly generate professional, on-brand content for any client across all marketing channels.

## üöÄ What This Is

**Instant Marketing Mastery** is a revolutionary Claude Code command structure that transforms how marketing agencies create content. Instead of starting from scratch every time, you can instantly generate professional marketing materials that are:

- **Globally Consistent**: Every piece follows your agency's copywriting standards
- **Client-Specific**: Automatically adapts to each client's brand voice and positioning  
- **Channel-Optimized**: Templates for every marketing channel from Google Ads to YouTube Shorts
- **Data-Driven**: Built-in analytics and reporting frameworks
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new clients and content types

## üéØ Perfect For

- **Marketing Agencies** looking to scale content production
- **Freelance Marketers** wanting professional templates and workflows
- **In-House Marketing Teams** needing consistent, high-quality content
- **Consultants** requiring rapid client onboarding and deliverable creation
- **Anyone** who wants to leverage Claude Code for marketing content

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### The Smart Context System

Every command references two key files:
1. **Global Copywriting Rules** (`.claude/copywriting-rules.md`) - Your agency standards
2. **Client-Specific Context** (`.claude/commands/CLIENT/client-context.md`) - Each client's unique details

This means every piece of content automatically:
- Follows your copywriting best practices
- Uses the client's brand voice and messaging
- Addresses their specific audience and pain points
- Maintains consistency across all materials
